Hey! 

I'm Paul - been building tech startups for a while now. Started as a CTO (4 times actually), now I'm running Tango.Vision. We're basically trying to give buildings a soul. Yeah, I know how that sounds, but trust me on this one.

Anyway, I've been playing around with AI a lot lately and honestly, some of the stuff I've figured out is pretty wild. I'm talking prompts that actually work, custom GPTs that solve real problems, and AI solutions that aren't just hype.

So I figured why not share what I've learned? This channel is where I'll dump all the good stuff - the prompts that actually get results, the GPTs I've built that are actually useful, and maybe some other AI tricks I've picked up along the way.

No fancy marketing speak, just real stuff that works.

Let's go!
