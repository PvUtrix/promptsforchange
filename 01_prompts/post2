The first prompt will help you open up to the world of endless possibilities, give it a try.

"I want to identify and challenge my limiting beliefs that may be hindering my entrepreneurial journey. Acting as a mindset coach, ask me probing questions, one by one, to uncover any deep-seated beliefs I have about business, success, or my own abilities. After each response, help me analyze how these beliefs might be holding me back and suggest ways I can reframe them to support my growth and success, before asking the next question. The goal is to break my mental barriers with your guidance."
